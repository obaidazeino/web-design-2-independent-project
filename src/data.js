As someone who‚Äôs had a comprehensive taste of the burning hell of depression for a few months and have gotten out of it stronger than ever without submitting to the narrative of the biological ilnesss to which the patient is a passive victim, I believe depression is your body telling you there is something deeply wrong going on in your life or your thought patterns and outlook on life (isnt that all that matters anyways?). It‚Äôs impossible to pin down one cause but I do believe that even if the cause goes way back in your psychological history or involves complex trauma you may or may not be particularly conscious of, there is an answer and a way forward as soon as you acknowledge your problem and strive for constructive change, resolution of life probelms, and therapy of your psyche with plenty of psychological assistance available today. However, it can definitely be the case that the depressed person is paralyzed to the point of dysfunctionality and maybe antidepressants can help jump start a positive change but their intake should be temporary in the majority of cases and the goal should involve more psychological therapy and recovery and as little and brief dependence on pharmaceuticals as possible.",

The waves of hysterical yelling and infants‚Äô cries surrounding me were far more powerful than the waves of the heartless sea in which we‚Äôre sailing. I chose to take a short nap so I could forget about the present for a while and get the precious opportunity to dream about arriving at the Greek shores safe and sound to seek refuge. Interestingly, I did not yet realize that this experience would reveal more about me than I ever knew, and more about how dirty, selfish and disgusting this world is, than anyone would ever imagine.",

It was only meant to bring me up shortly after. She stretched her arm with the piece of bread further towards me interrupting my noisy train of thought. At that moment, words were simply not as loyal to me as my physical reflexes. I pulled her strongly to my chest with both arms and hugged her tightly. On a side note, it was almost the same type of hug I would give to my mother while scared of ghosts at night when I was her age, except far more uplifting.",
                    "My encounter with my hero lasted no more than a few seconds. My hero disappeared among people, but her confident reassuring presence remained with me up to this moment, along with a piece of bread. After that, I was no longer sitting weak and fragile in a corner. I had just had the most detailed few-seconds lesson on how to be strong. I learned that the journey I was obliged to take in order to survive can be tough, but my life-loving spirit must always be tougher. I learned that the world can be an unjust place; very unjust in fact that it would decide who deserves to live and who deserves to die, who has to go through pain and who doesn‚Äôt, based on arbitrary geographic locations, but it remains my responsibility to resist injustice and stand up for myself. My mouth out sped my thoughts again and concluded the internal battle against my vulnerable self with a victorious smile",

Considering that this is a tutorial post not a dystopic tragic narrative, it would be sensible to refrain from completing the story for now. Nevertheless, in a humble attempt to reduce the number of people who have to suffer from this on a regular basis, I present you my life-saving essay. When trying to fry an egg, make sure to consider the precautions, break the eggs, add the ingredients and fry the mixture.",
                    "Precautions: Going through the process of frying an egg is a bigger commitment that you think. For a happy ending, it is best to be prepared to completely isolate yourself from the outer world for a solid ten minutes, be done with all other matters (urinary ones in particular) and focus ONLY on frying the egg. The ingredients you will need to fry an egg are: oil, courage, salt, surprisingly, an egg and some more courage. As a beginner, it is best to try one egg first so that you don‚Äôt make my mistake (spoiler alert) and lose five eggs at once. Unless someone else is joining you, in which case I recommend frying an even number of eggs so you don‚Äôt make my other mistake (spoiler alert #2) and end up with a blurred eyesight for fighting over the extra egg before you even start frying.",
                    "Break the eggs: If you‚Äôre on a limited supply of eggs and you‚Äôre really not sure whether you will be able to fry them successfully, you might feel your heart breaking with each egg, which, I assure you, is a completely normal symptom. After you man up and finish breaking the eggs, mix the yellow part with the white part, stop mixing when the color approaches that of Donald Trump‚Äôs hair.",
                    "Add the ingredients: Place the pan on the stove, add a small amount of warm oil to it, put some salt, and then pour the Trump-colored mixture on top of it. The following step can massively raise the bar of prerequisite skillsets for some of you, however once you absolutely master all the previous steps (including being able to identify Mr. Trump‚Äôs hair color), you can proceed to some next level pro material that involves adding some more cheese or chicken to it. And yes, it does seem very complicated.",
                    "Fry the mixture: I sincerely wish this does not sound as complicated anymore after I‚Äôve mentioned the cheese and chicken part. All you need to bear in mind is that the mixture you‚Äôre dealing with is no ordinary mixture, since it can stick to the pan in no time and leave you bankrupt of all options; so if you want to see light at the end of the tunnel, be sure to keep shaking the pan and the mixture inside as it solidifies. Theoretically, the mixture takes about five minutes of frying on low heat to be ready.",
                    "To conclude, scrambling eggs can be tough, but if you somehow miraculously end up with an edible result, you will realize that it is worth the effort. Also, if you have gone this far reading my post, and most importantly did not eat the scrambled eggs directly from the pan to save yourself an extra dish to wash, you have won yourself the title of an ‚Äúegg-frying master‚Äù."
